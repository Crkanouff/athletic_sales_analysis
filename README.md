# athletic_sales_analysis
Module 5 Challenge
This codes concats 2 csv files that have exactly the same column information. It describles althletic sales for years 2021 and 2022. The excercise was for practing our combining skills, renaming columns, locating and filtering information from the dataframe and they using groupby and pivot tables to show results.

This was the first project that I was able to complete on my own. Although I did get stuck on a few items, I was able to find my errors working with our TA and I was able to use prompts to CHAT Gpt to explain why I was getting only output, and not tables from the dataframe.
